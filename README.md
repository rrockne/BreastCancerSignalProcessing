# BreastCancerSignalProcessing
Data and MATLAB codes to reproduce results reported in Matache et al. 2025 manuscript titled "Ligand Discrimination in Immune Cells: Signal Processing Insights into Immune Dysfunction in ER+ Breast Cancer" 

The files run_HD.m and run_BC.m will unzip the data file ("data.zip" located on Zenodo DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.16906422 ) and perform all signal-to-noise (SNR) and probability of error (Pe) calculations for healhty donor and breast cancer patient datasets, respectively. Data is anonymized and aggregated flow cytometry analysis of peripheral blood immune cells with and without cytokine stimulation.
